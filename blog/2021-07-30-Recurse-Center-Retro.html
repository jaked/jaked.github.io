Briefly, you work on whatever you want (toward improving as a programmer) with a bunch of other people pursuing similar goals. It was totally great, I highly recommend it! I want to reflect a little on my time there:</span></p><h2 id="how-did-i-spend-my-time-"><span>How did I spend my time?</span></h2><p><span>I did a whole bunch of stuff!

At each meeting the leader announces a &quot;prompt&quot; (an idea or topic to stimulate creative thought); then you have an hour and 45 minutes or so to code something with the prompt in mind; then the group reconvenes to show off what we made. It&#x27;s a good way to experiment with new ideas / technologies: there&#x27;s some pressure to complete something to show off, but the stakes and time commitment are low.</span></p><ul><li><p><span></span><a href="https://glitch.com/~sordid-vaulted-waterlily" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span><strong>think small</strong></span></a><span>: cuts up your webcam stream into small tiles and displays them randomly—I like the way it takes fragments out of context and arranges them in surprising juxtapositions.</span></p></li><li><p><span></span><a href="https://glitch.com/~meowing-succulent-eoraptor" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span><strong>infinity, the Library of Babel</strong></span></a><span>: a text editor that shows previous versions of the text—the Borges story </span><a href="https://maskofreason.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/the-library-of-babel-by-jorge-luis-borges.pdf" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>The Library of Babel</span></a><span> describes a library containing all possible texts; I was also thinking of another Borges story, </span><a href="http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>Funes the Memorious</span></a><span>, about a person who remembers everything.</span></p></li><li><p><span></span><a href="https://glitch.com/~candle-deadpan-cucumber" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span><strong>hygge</strong></span></a><span>: a soothing (?) bit of background music made with the </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>Web Audio API</span></a><span>—this is a pretty low-level API and I spent a lot of time just trying to figure out how to make notes.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>mysterious</strong></span><span> (</span><a href="https://glitch.com/~navy-foil-clave" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>look away</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://glitch.com/~trail-nervous-manatee" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>don&#x27;t look away</span></a><span>): uses the </span><a href="https://ml5js.org/" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>ML5</span></a><span> pose estimator to detect when you&#x27;re looking at the camera (or have your thumb over the camera), then does something mysterious with that information.</span></p></li><li><p><span></span><a href="https://glitch.com/~iris-pie-coyote" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span><strong>replication</strong></span></a><span>: a text editor that permits only one text; if you change it, it mutates back to the original—my first attempt didn&#x27;t really work and I spent several more hours figuring out how to compute </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>edit distance</span></a><span> and use it to mutate the text. </span></p></li><li><p><span></span><a href="https://glitch.com/~uneven-sunny-melon" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span><strong>you can only make one dot at a time</strong></span></a><span>: experiments with making fragment shaders, but implemented on a </span><span><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></span><span>—I had recently paired with someone on their </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>WebGL</span></a><span> project, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend time figuring out the mechanics.</span></p></li><li><p><span></span><a href="https://glitch.com/~foil-hollow-felidae" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span><strong>emphasize repetition</strong></span></a><span>: simple step sequencer using </span><a href="https://reactjs.org/" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>React</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>Tone.js</span></a><span>—someone had recently demo&#x27;d a Tone.js project and I wanted to try it.

I felt motivated and energized to get up early every morning and work, because I had other people to work with, a structure of checking in with other people about my progress, and the opportunity to present my work and get feedback.</span></p><p><span>I really enjoyed meeting a bunch of new people, discovering shared interests, and collaborating—mid-pandemic that was something I badly needed. It felt really good to join a welcoming and supportive community. (After you&#x27;ve done a batch, you &quot;never graduate&quot;, and can continue to participate in the community.)</span></p><p><span>There is something special about the RC community—people are more welcoming, supportive, and helpful than in most other places on the internet. I think this is in large part because there are explicit </span><a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>social rules</span></a><span> guiding behavior; and also because the staff &quot;gardens&quot; the community: helps enforce the social rules, connects people who might like to be connected, supports people who want to organize events, etc.</span></p><p><span>RC sustains itself by recruiting for software companies, and I used their recruiting services after my batch. While my job search didn&#x27;t pan out the way I&#x27;d hoped, the experience of working with RC on it was great and I would do it again. The RC staff is in a good position (from interacting with you in the community) to understand what you&#x27;re looking for and what your strengths are; and they&#x27;re trying to build long-term relationships, not just earn a fee.</span></p><h2 id="what-was-not-so-good-"><span>What was not so good?</span></h2><p><span>I wrote an earlier </span><a href="/blog/2021-02-12-Recurse-Center"><span>post</span></a><span> about how I planned to spend my batch. Aside from working on Programmable Matter, and collaborating with lots of interesting new people, I did not do much on the list! But that is OK—I liked the feeling of being receptive to ideas and projects as they arose.</span></p><p><span>I&#x27;d planned to write a blog post a week during my batch, but I ended up getting caught up in various projects and groups, and didn&#x27;t make time for it after the first couple weeks. I feel like I have a backlog of bloggable material (mostly about various aspects of Programmable Matter) and I hope to write it up in the coming months.</span></p><p><span>The &quot;retreat&quot; part of RC is important (even though it&#x27;s not a physical retreat right now): it&#x27;s an opportunity to set aside some expectations and responsibilities in order to pursue something with a pure intention, purpose, and commitment. This is very fun and rewarding, but contains a little sadness—I felt a background anxiety around making good use of the time, and about having to reenter the &quot;real world&quot; when it was over. On the other hand, this feeling has made me want to try harder to find ongoing work that brings a similar sense of reward.</span></p><h2 id="you-should-be-part-of-the-recurse-center-"><span>You should be part of the Recurse Center!</span></h2><p><span>If you&#x27;re interested in improving as a programmer, I highly recommend doing an RC batch and joining the community—you can </span><a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply" class="sc-gtsrHT kFWJEY"><span>apply here</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Please </span><a href="/blog/mailto%3Ajake%40donham.org"><span>email me</span></a><span> with comments, criticisms, or corrections.</span></p></div></body></html>
